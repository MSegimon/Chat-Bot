# Chat Bot
---
### Final Goal For This Bot
This project is an AI chat bot with the end goal of being able to have a decent conversation with the user. A conversation is defined as a back and forth of questions and answers between the bot and the user. I am not considering telling stories as part of a conversation because the bot is not a human, and as such it has no experiences and no stories to tell.

### Current Goal
The current goal is to train the bot with the responses to questions, the way this is being achieved through a SQL database were all of the questions and responses from both the user and Wolfram Alpha are being stored. This database is then expanded upon as you have conversations with the bot.
